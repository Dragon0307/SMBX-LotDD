It was a long time ago, civilization had but started. A mysterious force from beyond this world dropped star-shaped objects onto the ground. These had rather... unusual effects.
With them in place, the world began to prosper. Crops would grow larger, lives would last longer, and certain plants and fungi gained power-bestowing properties. 
However, if they were to be removed from their rightful places, the effects of these objects would be drastically reversed. If enough were removed from one place, the surrounding region would experience a great apocalypse.
One creature in particular seeked to devour these objects to empower itself. We call it the Abomination. The specemien was impossible to defeat, so we had to take the next best measure.
Forming a blade from fallen stars, the Koopa tribe laid seige to this monster and forced a through a gate to a broken dimension known as the Minus World. A barrier was errected which only the weapon could destroy.
Since that day, the sword became known as the Star Blade, the barrier became known as the Dark Door and the star-shaped objects became known as Power Stars.
