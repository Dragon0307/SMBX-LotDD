Snifft: Ladies and Gentlesniffits! Today we have a special guest on Sniffit or Whiffit: Lava Pit Edition - Mr. Mario "Super Mario" Mario!
Mario: What-a-bout-a the free-a Robux from that-a block?
Sniffit: What Robux? I haven't a clue what you're talking about. But if it's free, then it's probably too good to be true. Anyway, welcome to Sniffit or Whiffit!
Sniffit: See, if you do well you'll win points. If you get enough, you'll win today's grand prize: The Obsidian Boots! These are special shoes that are all black and shiny,
    and not to mention, unpractical! You can't run with them on and don't even think of trying to sprint. I guess they could let you stand in lava, but they don't fit on my feet
    so I haven't tried. (First try)
Sniffit: See, if you do well you'll win points. If you get enough, you'll win today's grand prize: The Casino Card! This card is made of solid gold, so it paints a big "mug me" 
    sign over your head. Not to mention, it is also an exclusive card from our sponsor: The Shy Guy Mafia's Dodgy Casino! Ever wanted to do boring shoehorned minigames which
    directly fund organized crime? Well now you can! (Second try)
Sniffit: And, if you get any wrong, you'll lose a life. If you run out of lives... well, you'll get a nice, warm bath.

Correct! Next question.
Oops! You got that wrong! Lose a life.
Uh-oh! Seems you're out of lives! Thank you for playing, and we'll try to fish out your charred rem,ains later today. Probably.
Well, it seems you got everything right! As promises, here's your prize.
Wow, you got everything right! Here - take the grand prize for the day: The Fire Emblem! It's a shield that lets you shoot fireballs anywhere - even underwater! No, it doesn't 
protect against anything. Dragon killing sword not included.
