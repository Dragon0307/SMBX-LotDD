Uuuun... Uninvited guests, have we? Leave, nest. Unless, you have come... to feed.
Feeeeeed.... Feeeeeeed....
Tell you a tale...
Long ago... live happy... feed happy...
But then... sparking blade, dark door... No more.
Wait for freedom, never come. Plead for help, ever fail.
Forgotten in a world of negatives.
Then... yellow and purple... smell of malaice, greed set me free...
Give what purple need, 
Life return... There's no price of liberty... but blood.

Brave red, who ascends the castle of fruits. A challenge for you.
Portals send things far. You, friend, foe, or fire.
Use wisely, you can succeed. Fail, you shall from shall you be feed.
Persevere!

Far you have come, but nowhere you have been. The nest upon I wait. Open the door, and be feed, or succeed!

Portals are fail. Close for victory!
No... No More!
