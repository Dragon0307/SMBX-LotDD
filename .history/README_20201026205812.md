Super Mario Brothers X: Legend of the Dark Door (An SMBX episode)

THIS EPISODE REQUIRES SMBX BETA 4 PATCH 3 OR LATER!

Princess Peach has embraced militarization and the Mushroom Kingdom's army took the chance to pummel Bowser into submission so that he would stop kidnapping Peach. However, an evil
entity calls out to Wario and Waluigi from the depths of the Piranha Plant forest...

This episode uses a unique RPG-style experience and damage system - Most enemies now have a health bar that you need to deplete before they actually take any damage. However, you also gain experience and level up as you defeat enemies, increasing your damage output slightly.
