Uuuun... Uninvited guests, have we? Leave, nest. Unless, you have come... to feed.
Feeeeeed.... Feeeeeeed....
Tell you a tale...
Long ago... live happy... feed happy...
But then... sparking blade, purple door... No more.
Wait for freedom, never come. Plead for help, ever fail.
Forgotten in a world of negatives.
Then... yellow and purple... smell of malaice, greed...
Yellow never seen again, but purple come, open prison...
Give what purple need,  Life return...

Brave red, who ascends the castle of fruits. A challenge for you.
Portals send things far. You, friend, foe, or fire.
Use wisely, you can succeed. Fail, you shall from shall you be feed.
Persevere!

Far you have come, but nowhere you have been. The nest upon I wait. Open the door, and be feed, or succeed!

Portals are fail. Close for victory!
No... No More!

Waluigi: Wah! Yah finally come to stop me? I'm suprised you got out of that door. Nonetheless, the world is mine! AND the Abomination serves me! Go, my pet!
Waluigi: Waaaah!?! You're weaken'in it! Waaaaah! Ya can't do Wah-t!
